In day-to-day life, we face questions like: which phone/laptop to buy? We go on websites looking for it, 
so this project will help us find the best product with ratings on websites and price.

1st step is Web Scraping and that code/data is in Web Scraping data folder.

Please go through the project_flask.py file as the project is based on database connectivity, 
so you need to create the database before running the project_flask file directly.

Thank You!!
